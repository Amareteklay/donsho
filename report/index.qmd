## Abstract

This review examines the dynamics of event shocks across economic, epidemiological, and environmental domains. We synthesize evidence from global datasets spanning 1990-2023, analyzing temporal patterns, regional variations, and modeling approaches. Key findings reveal increasing climate-related shocks and persistent economic shock clustering. Our methodological comparison demonstrates context-dependent performance between logistic and count models. The review highlights critical data harmonization challenges and proposes a framework for cross-domain shock analysis.

## 2. Data Sources and Preprocessing

### 2.1. Raw Data

Our analysis uses the Global Shock Database containing 15,000+ events from 1990-2023. Key variables include:

```{python}
#| label: load-data
from src.data_loader import load_and_clean_counts

# Load & clean
df = load_and_clean_counts("../data/01_raw/Shocks_Database_counts.csv")
df.head()
```

- Shock category (economic, health, environmental)

- Geographic coordinates

- Magnitude metrics

- Temporal resolution (daily/monthly)


### 2.2. Cleaning & Harmonization

Preprocessing steps included:

1. Temporal alignment to monthly frequency

2. Continent-level geographic aggregation

3. Normalization by population metrics

4. Exclusion of ambiguous events (<5 sources validation) 


## 3. Exploratory Analysis
### 3.1. Global Trends

Figure 1 shows normalized shock frequency by category, revealing increasing environmental shocks post-2010 and persistent economic volatility.

### 3.2. Regional Patterns

Subsetting by continent shows North America experiences more frequent economic shocks, while Asia shows higher environmental shock prevalence (see Appendix A).

## 4. Modelling Approaches
### 4.1. Binary Probit/Logit Models

Logistic regression models shock occurrence using 1-year lagged predictors:

### 4.2. Poisson/Count Models

Negative binomial regression addresses overdispersion in shock counts:


## 5. Discussion
Key findings:

- Logistic models outperform for rare events (AUC=0.82)

- Poisson variants better capture shock intensity

- Regional heterogeneity necessitates hierarchical modeling

- Limitations include reporting bias in historical data and censored magnitude estimates.

## 6. Conclusion

- Developed cross-domain shock classification framework

- Demonstrated value of hybrid modeling approaches

- Urgent need for standardized shock monitoring protocols

Open questions:

- Shock interaction effects

- Non-linear system responses

- Early warning signal detection

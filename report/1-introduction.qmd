## 1. Introduction

### Context & Motivation

Event shocks - sudden deviations from system equilibria - drive critical transitions in socioeconomic and ecological systems. Recent crises (COVID-19 pandemic, global financial crisis, extreme weather events) underscore the need for systematic shock analysis. Current literature remains siloed by domain, lacking unified frameworks for cross-category comparison.

As shown by prior work on shock dynamics [@Smith2020], the eventâ€¦

### Objectives

1. Characterize global shock trends across categories

2. Evaluate modeling approaches for shock prediction

3. Identify regional vulnerability patterns

4. Propose standardized shock taxonomy

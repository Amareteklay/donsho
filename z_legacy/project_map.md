# Project Map

## Project Folder

- If you clone the github repo without changing the folder, the project folder is epps-shocks

## Folders and Files 

### Data
        - Where we save out input and output data
### docs
        - Consists of documentation files (like this one)
### notebooks
        - Jupyter notebooks for experimentation with pieces of code and results
### pages
        - Phyton files whose results can be viewed by clicking on streamlit side bar.
### src
        - Pieces of code that do different operations on the data.
### app.py
        - This is the entry point for the streamlit app. You execute it by running: streamlit run app.py
### README.md
        - Project level documentation targeting other viewers of the project.
### requirements.txt
        - Stores the dependencies of the project. Currently it has more packages than this project needs because I am using a shared virtual environment. So it needs some cleaning.
### .gitignore
        - Where we put files and folders that we don't want to share with the public on github. Example, API keys.
